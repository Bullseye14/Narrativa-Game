Hello, Dahlia. We are the Destiny's Moiras, and we make sure that everything follows its path.
We presume you are aware that chaos taken over Talay, your village, and we want you to take care of this.
Every time you have to make a decision, we will be there to guide you towards destiny.
Be aware that sometimes, what destiny wants is not what you think it is correct...
Do what destiny says, and you will be compensated, or don't... That is up to you.
